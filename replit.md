## Recent Changes
- **2025-06-27**: Database fully operational with complete schema synchronization and table limit system functional
- **Table Limit System**: Subscription-based table creation limits fully implemented with real-time enforcement
- **Database Schema**: All 66 tables properly created including tenants, restaurants, tables, subscription_plans, and booking system
- **Bug Fix Resolution**: Resolved function redeclaration errors that were preventing guest booking system from loading properly
- **Special Periods Smart Logic**: When "Restaurant is open during this period" is enabled, system uses custom opening/closing times from special period configuration instead of blocking dates
- **Dynamic Time Slots**: Guest booking system generates time slots based on special period hours when restaurant is open during configured periods
- **Flexible Configuration**: Special periods now support both closure periods (blocked dates) and modified hours periods (custom times)
- **Comprehensive Booking Restrictions**: Guest booking system prevents bookings based on opening hours, special periods, and cut-off time configurations
- **Calendar Integration**: Calendar view visually disables dates blocked by configuration restrictions while allowing dates with modified hours
- **Enhanced Validation**: Updated time slot validation and generation to prioritize special period hours over regular opening hours
- **System Stability**: Guest booking system now loads without errors and properly handles all configuration scenarios
- **Priority System Implementation**: Established clear booking restriction hierarchy - Special periods override opening hours, cut-off times enforce time buffers
- **Cut-off Time Logic**: Enhanced cut-off validation to handle both hourly (1:00 = 1 hour before) and daily (24:00 = 1 day before) restrictions
- **Cut-off Time Fix**: Fixed hourly cut-off logic - if current time is 11:00 AM and cut-off is 1 hour, blocks bookings until after 12:00 PM

- **Skeleton Components**: Added RestaurantInfoSkeleton, CalendarSkeleton, TimeSlotsSkeletonGrid, BookingFormSkeleton, and TableSelectionSkeleton
- **Enhanced UX**: Loading states now show elegant animated placeholders while data loads instead of blank or loading spinners
- **Heat-Map Integration**: Heat-map now uses actual table positions, shapes, and rotations from table-plan page instead of hardcoded positions
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Added animated heat rings for high-performance tables, improved tooltips with detailed metrics, and room backgrounds
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed guest booking error by adding comprehensive null checks to isTimeSlotValid function preventing undefined property access
- **User Experience**: Tables now display exactly where positioned in table-plan with correct visual representation and interactive effects
