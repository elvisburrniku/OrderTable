Goal:
Develop a restaurant booking dashboard that integrates a 1:1 Google Calendar clone for handling reservations, along with full restaurant-specific features. The system should be modular, scalable, and production-ready, supporting real restaurant operations such as table planning, multi-room support, customer communication, payment handling, and analytics.

All core components must work together seamlessly, with consistent UI/UX across the platform. Focus on data integrity, real-time updates, and user experience for both internal staff and external integrations.
