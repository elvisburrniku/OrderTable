What you need: Stripe Connect
Stripe Connect lets your platform:

Onboard your clients to create or connect their own Stripe accounts

Process payments on their behalf

Manage payouts to your clients

Optionally take a platform fee from transactions

Steps to enable your clients to accept payments with Stripe Connect:
1. Choose your Connect account type
Standard: Clients create their own Stripe account and log in via Stripe’s dashboard. You redirect them to Stripe onboarding. You have less control but simpler to implement.

Express: You have a custom onboarding UI, Stripe handles the dashboard for your clients.

Custom: Full control, but more responsibility (compliance, KYC, etc.)

Most SaaS platforms use Express or Standard.

2. Create Connect accounts for your clients
You direct your client to connect or create a Stripe account via OAuth or API.

Example for Standard (OAuth):

plaintext
Copy
Edit
https://connect.stripe.com/oauth/authorize
?response_type=code
&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&scope=read_write
When they authorize, you get a code which you exchange for their Stripe account ID and access tokens.

3. Store connected account IDs
Once connected, save your client’s Stripe account ID (like acct_1ABC...) in your database.

4. Create charges or payment intents on behalf of connected accounts
When your client’s customer pays, create the payment on their connected account by passing the stripe_account option.

Example in Node.js:

js
Copy
Edit
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'usd',
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  // optional application fee (if you take a cut)
  application_fee_amount: 100,
}, {
  stripeAccount: connectedAccountId // client's Stripe account ID
});
This way, the money goes directly to your client’s Stripe account.

5. Handle payouts and compliance
Stripe handles payouts to your clients automatically depending on their account type.

You might need to collect some info from your clients to satisfy compliance/KYC.

Summary for your case:
Use Stripe Connect to onboard your clients.

Your clients connect their Stripe account to your platform (via OAuth or API).

You create payments and subscriptions on behalf of their connected accounts.

Your clients receive payouts to their bank accounts directly.

You can charge a platform fee if you want.
